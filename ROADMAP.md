# Roadmap (Aligned to PDF Blueprint)

Core Pillars
- Indicators: SATY ATR (levels/bands/targets), Ripster EMA clouds, Pivot Ribbon (8/21/34), Ichimoku, TTM Squeeze
- Confluence: Unicorn Score (trend + volatility + momentum + structure) with contributions and explainability
- Regime: Daily states, confluence gating, regime‑filtered analytics
- Execution: Alpaca paper/live with risk guardrails and ops panel
- Automation: n8n relay for signals/orders/alerts
- Analytics: backtests, expectancy curves, CSV export

Next Milestones
1) Signals/Trade guidance popovers completion
2) Backtest batch CSV (multi‑symbol) with regime filters
3) Daily bars shared cache across endpoints; ETag on bars
4) MTF presets (e.g., intraday + 1D; later 4H)
5) Streaming data provider toggle (websocket where supported) with graceful fallback
6) Persisted analytics store for longitudinal study (optional)

Done (Highlights)
- Deep links (URL sync + copy link)
- Symbol search (Alpaca assets, cached)
- Ichimoku cloud shading
- Backtest curves + PF; daily regime filter; server caches + ETag
- Trading guardrails (market open, positions, risk%, daily loss cap, exposure, cooldown)
- Orders/Positions panel
- SATY bands/lines + targets panel
- Guidance on major panels (Overlays, Squeeze, SATY, Backtest, Orders, Trade)
