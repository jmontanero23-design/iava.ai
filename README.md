# iAVA.ai Project

Welcome to the iAVA.ai project, a world-class AI-driven platform focused on finance and automation. This project integrates a modern React + Vite frontend scaffold to accelerate UI work and future integrations.

## Project Structure
- `src/components`: UI and frontend components.
- `src/services`: Backend logic and API helpers (placeholder).
- `src/utils`: Utility functions and helpers.
- `index.html`: Vite entry HTML.
- `vite.config.js`: Vite config with React plugin.

## Objectives
- Integrate and analyze trading indicators (e.g., SADI/SATY, Ripster EMA Clouds, TTM Squeeze, Ichimoku).
- Develop AI-driven workflows using N8N for automation.
- Provide a user-friendly web interface on iava.ai.

## Getting Started
- Prereqs: Node.js 18+ (Node 22 preferred) and npm.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev` (open the URL it prints, typically `http://localhost:5173`)
- Build for prod: `npm run build`
- Preview local build: `npm run preview` (serves `dist/`)

## Next Steps
- Define real API endpoints and connect them in `src/services/`.
- Add actual UI components under `src/components/` for indicators and workflows.
- Wire up auth, routing, and state management as needed.
